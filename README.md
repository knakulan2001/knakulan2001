##About me
ðŸ”­ Looking for Software Engineering and Web Development job oppurtunities!

ðŸŒ± Learning and working with ReactJS and various AWS Services (Lambdas, API Gateways, Application Load Balancers, DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, etc.)!

âš¡ Fun fact about me: If a job can be accomplished in a more efficient manner, I won't stop until I figure out how to do so!

I'm currently a Computer Science student (anticipated to graduate in December 2022) and a Software Engineer. I am proficient in both mobile and web development environments. I am adept at using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Dart, Java, C++, and other programming languages to produce clean code with robust documentation. As a well-organized and collaborative team player with strong communication and analytical abilities, I am capable of delivering quality products to clients in fast-paced environments. I am constantly inflicted with an intense desire to learn more about relevant fields of interest as a software engineer!
